# Upstox-api-RIL-data-ETL-AWS


This project implements an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data.

**Pipeline Stages**

The pipeline follows these three stages:

1. **Extract:** Data is retrieved from a source system. (e.g., Amazon EventBridge in this example)
2. **Transform:** The data is converted into a format suitable for the target system. This may involve cleaning, formatting, or deriving new data points.
3. **Load:** The transformed data is loaded into a designated target system (data warehouse, data lake, analytics platform).
